# Python code for the Mie differential cross section of a single dielectric particle.

Consult with the Jupyter notebook, `scattering-cross-section.ipynb`

This file includes simple examples about an infinitely long cylinder (2D) and a sphere (3D).

* Requirements:
    - scipy
    - numpy

* To Do:
    - Add cases of complex-valued dielectric constant.
    - Add functions for the extinct / absorption cross sections
